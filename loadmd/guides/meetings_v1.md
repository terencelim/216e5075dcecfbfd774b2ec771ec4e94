## Informal / Simple Meeting Minutes Sample
### MINUTES: PROJECT CHECK-IN MEETING

### Our Objective
To build a measurement strategy that allows the customer success team to track progress on KPIs and measure that progress against their stated departmental goals.

### Deadlines/Milestones
Strategy must be ready to deploy by Q4 2023.

### Project Update Roundtable

|Speaker|Update|
|:------|:-----|
|Rob    | • Spoke with and established agreement among CS team stakeholders on relevant KPIs. </br> • Gathered feedback from CS team on current measurement strategies. |
| Christina | • Mocked up three dashboard options that are circulating internally for feedback. </br> • Working through an audit of the current CS data sources. |
| Michelle | • Just getting back after a four-day illness; catching up. |

### Roadblocks & Risks
**Roadblock:**
- Christina needs feedback on the dashboards before she can continue. All team members must provide feedback ASAP.  

**Risk:**
- Christina’s audit may reveal siloed data which may delay our ability to establish a performance baseline.

### Next Steps
- @Michelle review and provide feedback on Christina’s dashboard mockups by June 5th.
- @Rob summarize and distribute CS team feedback on current measurement strategies by June 7th.
- @Christina check in on the status of current CS data sources by June 8th.
