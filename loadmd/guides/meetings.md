## Example Meeting Notes
### Purpose
Decide whether to renew our PR agency contract for another year

### Scribe: Allison Brown

### Agenda:
- Review agency results to date (actual vs. goal)
    - Media mentions = 29 (Goal was 50)

        -  Agency has large proportion of junior members
        -  We often have to follow up repeatedly to make sure work gets done
- **Decision:**
    - Renew for 1 month to finish current initiatives (Darren)

# Meeting Cheat Sheet

### Core Values
  1. Meeting scarcity over meeting abundance.
  2. Thoughtful scheduling over broad invitations.
  3. Active discussion over mind-numbing presentation.
  4. Freely sharing over knowledge silos.

### Scheduling Meetings
- Invite fewer people whenever possible
- Build meeting clusters by scheduling meetings near other meetings
- Avoid marathon meetings (1 hour max)

### Conducting Meetings
- Active discussion > passive presentation
- If you shouldn’t be there, leave the meeting
- Every task gets a DRI (directly responsible individual)
- Follow up by sharing notes within 24 hours
- No distracting technology used for non-meeting activities (phones, laptops, etc.)

# Meetings need a **PURPOSE** and an **OBJECTIVE**  

The main difference between a meeting **purpose** and a meeting **objective** is that:
- the **Purpose** is the reason why you’re having a meeting, 
- the **Objective** is the desired outcome of the meeting.

The meeting **Purpose** is:  
  - The cause of your meeting that brings everyone together
  - A bit abstract and not measurable:
    - it's the driving idea behind the meeting, 
    - not the concrete goals to accomplish

The meeting **Objective** is:  
  - a set of specific goals that you want to achieve:
    - Examples:
      - make a decision about launch date, 
      - come up with 3 team OKRs for the next quarter, 
      - review and gather input on latest landing page designs
  - Measurable and concrete - these objectives will guide the meeting agenda and action items

_**Remember:** you need both a Purpose and Objective to have an effective meeting! And you can combine these into a **"meeting goal"** if you find that simpler. See example below_

## **Example**  
> **Meeting Purpose:** _To narrow down the list of qualified candidates for the open account manager position._  
> **Meeting Objectives:**  _Choose the top three candidates to reach out for a second interview._  

_**OR**_

> **Meeting Goal (Purpose and Objective combined):**  _Interview for the open account manager position, narrowing down list of qualified candidates to top three (3) for second interview._

## Meeting with **PURPOSE** = less meetings!

The **"secret sauce"**?  
- **<span style="color:red;">NO Agenda/Purpose?</span> = <span style="color:red;">&#10007; NO MEETING!</span>**  
- **<span style="color:red;">NO Objective?</span> = <span style="color:red;">&#10007; NO MEETING!</span>**  
- <span style="color:green;">It's okay to cancel recurring meetings when they no longer serve a purpose (excluding 1:1s)</span>

# Ideal Meeting Lengths and Attendees

Meeting Type | Length | Attendees | Why?
:------------:|:------:|:---------:| ----
Update | 18 min | 2-10 | - Research on attention spans shows that when acting as an audience, most people can pay passive attention for only 10 to 18 minutes. <br/> - Most meetings spent on updates go on far too long; a clear, concise meeting to align the team can be helpful as long as it is short.
Decision | 52 min | 2-6 | - Too many participants results in conflicting input, making it harder to make progress and reach a decision. Limit these meetings to six people. <br/> - Also, studies show that 52 minutes is the ideal maximum duration for focused work, meaning that meetings over an hour have diminishing returns.
Brainstorm | 52 min | 4-12 | • Unlike decision-making, brainstorming benefits from having more and diverse points of view. For these meetings, tap into the collective creativity of a slightly larger group than the decision-making group.
Rally the troops | 110 min | 2-2,000+ | - A typical film’s runtime is 110 minutes. For an all-hands or other major meeting, this is the longest you will want to stretch your audience’s attention. <br/> - Note that if you’re going to hold a meeting with the runtime of a movie, think about the pacing of your meeting like a film as well. Use the following to keep everyone engaged: <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - anticipation, <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - excitement, and <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - a dramatic finale.

# Want a good meeting? Begin by clarifying the goal

Meeting Type | Typical Size | Typical Characteristics | Typical Outcome
------------ | ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------
Decision Making | 6 to 8<br/>attendees | - Structured agenda identifies decision(s) to be made <br/> - Decision makers have been identified and are in the room <br/> - Active facilitation | Action
Discussion Meeting | 8 to 20<br/>attendees | - Structured agenda identifies discussion topics <br/> -  Active dialogue by attendees | Consideration
Information-sharing Meeting | 2 to 2,000+<br/>attendees | - Agenda clarifies topics for information sharing, although additional items may arise during the meeting <br/> - One-way communication from speaker | Awareness

# What is everyone’s role?

ROLE | DESCRIPTION
---- | -----------
Decision maker(s) | - are the only ones with a vote and the ones with responsibility to decide as they see fit; <br/> - if they get stuck, they should jointly align on how to escalate the decision or otherwise get the process unstuck, even if this means agreeing to “disagree and commit.”
Advisers | - give input and shape the decision. <br/> -  They have an outsize voice in setting the context of the decision and a big stake in its outcome - for example, the decision might affect their profit-and-loss statement. <br/> -  But they don’t have a vote on the decision.
Recommenders | - conduct the analyses, <br/> - explore the alternatives, <br/> - illuminate the pros and cons, and <br/> - ultimately recommend a course of action to the advisers and decision makers. <br/> - They see the day-to-day implications of the decision, but they also have no vote. <br/> - In general, the more recommenders the better in the process—but not in the decision meeting itself, as noted in the exhibit.
Execution partners | - don’t give input so much as get deeply involved in implementing the decision, and therefore they must be informed. <br/> - For speed and clarity, you will need the right ones in the room when the decision is made so they can ask clarifying questions and spot flaws that might hinder implementation. <br/> - Notably, the number of execution partners doesn’t necessarily depend on the importance of the decision. <br/> - An M&A decision, for example, might have just two execution partners: <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - the CFO and <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - a business-unit head.
